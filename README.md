The following project includes a deployed application for
my personal blog. It can be found at: https://auslanderina.onrender.com/ 
It has 3 routes where the response renders HTML using jinja2 templates.
It has a working database. However, it is missing the possibilities for
the user to create new database records, to edit existing database records
and to delete them. 

To run the app write python app.py in the terminal.
