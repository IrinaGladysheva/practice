The following project includes a Flask backend application
for my personal blog. It has 3 routes where the response
renders HTML using jinja2 templates. It also has an attempt
for having a data base, with 2 models, that was created using 
SQLAlchemy & SQLite. The data base seems not to be connected at 
the moment and I am still trying to figure it out. 
I will keep working on it until everything works out the way
itâ€™s supposed to be.

To run the app write python app.py in the terminal.
